# Diabetes-Prediction---Machine-Learning-Python-
Diabetes Prediction in Machine Learning 
# Diabetes Prediction Project

Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using a dataset containing various health metrics. The dataset includes features such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (whether the patient has diabetes or not).

The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, and the application of machine learning models to predict diabetes. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has diabetes based on the given features.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `diabetes.csv`. It contains 768 entries with the following features:

 Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
 BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
 Age: Age (years)
 Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

# Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded and initial exploration is performed to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values or duplicates.

2. Data Preprocessing: 
   - Handling missing values (if any).
   - Standardizing the features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Balancing the dataset using `RandomOverSampler` to handle class imbalance.

3. Data Visualization: 
   - Histograms, Heatmaps and Boxplots are plotted to visualize the distribution of each feature with respect to the outcome (diabetes or no diabetes).

4. Model Training and Evaluation: 
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - A machine learning model  is trained on the training set.
   - The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:

 Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
 NumPy: For numerical computations.
 Seaborn: For data visualization.
 Matplotlib: For plotting graphs.
 Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
 

# Usage

1. Load the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()`.

2. Data Exploration: Initial exploration is done to check for duplicates, missing values, and to get a summary of the dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing: The data is standardized and balanced to prepare it for model training.

4. Data Visualization: Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of features.

5. Model Training and Evaluation: A machine learning model is trained and evaluated using the preprocessed data.

# Results

The project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a patient has diabetes. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, and the results are visualized to understand the model's effectiveness.

# Future Work

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations that could improve model performance.
Model Tuning: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.

# Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting diabetes using machine learning. By exploring and preprocessing the data, and training a predictive model, we aim to contribute to early diabetes detection and improve patient outcomes.
